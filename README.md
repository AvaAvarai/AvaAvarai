# Alice Williams

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Alice, a double major B.Sc. student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics where I am in my final year, but exploring additional courses, before diving into graduate studies in Computational Science with a focus on Visual Machine Learning. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Visualization by blending computation with human cognition.

## Research Interests
- Visual Knowledge Discovery
- Data Mining & Data Visualization
- Deep Learning

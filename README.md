# Welcome

I’m Alice Williams, a technologist and trans woman from Texas, now based in Washington State. Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where I document and share work not under private licensing.  

My work focuses on interpretable machine learning, visual knowledge discovery, and human–AI collaborative systems, with the vision of building AI that thinks visibly and reasons transparently to assist human judgment rather than replace it, while sharing this work openly and learning from others.  

_This is a living document of my work and provides more context than my formal CV._

## Philosophy

**"I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.”**  
— _Albert Einstein, 1929_  

Quoted by Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk and Dmytro Dovhalets in: *Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning* from 2018 on Chapter 7 Interactive Visual Classification, Clustering and Dimension Reduction with GLC-L on page 173.

**"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."**  
Quoted by many as: **"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."**  
— _Albert Einstein, 1933_  

I’ve been writing code since before middle school and began studying it seriously in 6th grade (2004–2005).  
I write code to learn, explore, experiment, build tools, create art, earn, and bring ideas to life.  
My goal is to design simple, understandable systems and theory with the utmost reproducibility, modularity, and usability.

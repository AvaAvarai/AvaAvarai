**"I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.”**  
― _Albert Einstein 1929, quoted by Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk in Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning 2018._

## Academic Peer-Reviewed Publications

Research conducted during my undergraduate studies:

4. **Model Trust Measure through Model Sureness by Iterative Supervised Learning with Visual Knowledge Discovery**
- Authors: Alice Williams & Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Status: Approved for for Electronics MDPI journal feature article, manuscript in final stages.

3. **High-Dimensional Data Classification in Concentric Coordinates**
- Authors: Alice Williams & Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Status: Proposed to IV2025.
- Contributions: This paper introduces Concentric Coordinates (CoC), a lossless generalization of Parallel Coordinates for high-dimensional data visualization and classification. It enables interactive tuning of axis order, scaling, and rotation to reduce occlusion and reveal structure. CoC supports visual validation of k-NN, overlap detection, and ensemble refinement, and extends to 2D planar and 3D spatial forms. The paper also proposes a Generalized Iterative Classifier (GIC) for rule-based and linear refinement in a human-in-the-loop framework.

2. **["Boosting of Classification Models with Human-in-the-Loop Computational Visual Knowledge Discovery"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07039)**
- Authors: Alice Williams & Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Status: Preprint on ArXiv. Presenting at HCII2025.
- Contributions: Introduces the Computational and Interactive Visual Learning (CIVL) framework, integrating human-in-the-loop visualization and computational techniques to improve classification model boosting, particularly in class-overlapping areas, by separating simple and complex cases, leveraging interpretable decision rules, and enhancing classifier accuracy and explainability through lossless multidimensional visualizations like Parallel Coordinates and General Line Coordinates (GLCs). This improves classification model boosting, particularly in class-overlapping areas, by separating simple and complex cases, leveraging interpretable decision rules, and enhancing classifier accuracy and explainability through lossless multidimensional visualizations achieving 100% accuracy on the Fisher Iris data with significantly fewer parameters than AdaBoost, which won the 2003 Gödel Prize, reducing the risk of overfitting by maintaining a high case-to-parameter ratio while offering enhanced interpretability.
- Topics: Visual Knowledge Discovery, Classification Model Boosting, Interpretable Machine Learning, Human-in-the-Loop, Lossless Visualization
- Developed software: Java_Tabular_Vis_Toolkit, HyperblockParser, InLineCoordinatesCoefficientSolver

1. **["Synthetic Data Generation and Automated Multidimensional Data Labeling for AI/ML in General and Circular Coordinates"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02079)**
- Authors: Alice Williams & Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Status: Published in IEEE proceedings and presented at IV2024 in track of Artificial Intelligence and Visual Knowledge Discovery, earned the 'Best Paper Award'.
- Contributions: Proposed an algorithm and implemented interactive software for labeled synthetic data generation using former General Line Coordinate methods and newly developed Circular Coordinates both Static and Dynamic with multi-class visualization and parameterized class discrimination. Addressed data balancing, demonstrated deficiencies of popular SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), and showed improvements to classifier performance across 14 standard machine learning classifiers.
- Topics: Synthetic Data Generation, Automated Data Labeling, General Line Coordinates, Circular Coordinates, Parallel Coordinates, Shifted Paired Coordinates, Tabular AI/ML Data, Multidimensional Data Visualization, Visual Knowledge Discovery.
- Developed software: Dynamic_Coordinates_Vis_System

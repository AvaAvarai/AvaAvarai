"*I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.*”  
― Albert Einstein

# Alice Williams

Double major Bachelor's of Science undergraduate student, former system administrator, & full-stack software developer. Studying Computer Science & Applied Mathematics in my final year while exploring additional courses, next graduate studies in Computational Science with a focus on Visual Machine Learning. Solving problems at the intersection of Machine Learning & Data Visualization by blending computation with human cognition.

## Research Interests
Visual Knowledge Discovery, Data Mining, Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Automated Decision-Making

## Publications

**"[Proposal] Visual Boosting in Machine Learning with Human-in-the-Loop"**
- Written by: Alice Williams & Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Proposed for AI Human Computer Interfaces 2025.
- Contributions: Visual solution to the 2003 Gödel Prize problem of AdaBoost classifier by visual observation of options for different classifiers before selecting them for boosting allowing alternative ways to build stronger classifiers, including directly building classifiers in a lossless visualization space.

**["Synthetic Data Generation and Automated Multidimensional Data Labeling for AI/ML in General and Circular Coordinates"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02079)**
- Written by: Alice Williams & Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Presented at IV2024 (AI & VKD track) — Best Paper Award.
- Contributions: Proposed an algorithm for labeled synthetic data generation, addressed data balancing, and showed improvements to classifier performance across 14 standard classifiers.

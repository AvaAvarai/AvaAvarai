# Paper Written
- "Synthetic Data Generation and Automated Multidimensional Data Labeling for AI/ML in General and Circular Coordinates," co-authored with Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk.
  Presented at the 28th international conference IV2024 (Information Visualization) in AI&VKD (Artificial Intelligence and Visual Knowledge Discovery).
  - Proposed algorithm to generate quality labeled synthetic data with General Line Coordinates to visualize multidimensional data losslessly.
  - Demonstrated algorithm effectiveness for balancing data sets and addressing outliers in data sets (accentuating or diminishing, possibly relocating by attribute or entire case).
  - Demonstrated limitations with alternative methods of data balancing with synthetic data such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or standard sampling.
  - Improved classifier performances with synthetically augmented data.

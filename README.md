"*I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.*”  
― Albert Einstein 1929, quoted by Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk in Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning 2018

# Alice Williams

Double Bachelor's of Science senior student majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Active research assistant at the Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab of Central Washington University. Former system administrator, full-stack software developer, and web-developer. Next, graduate studies in Computational Science focusing on visual machine learning. With a goal of building expert artificial intelligence systems.  

Solving problems at the intersection of machine learning and data visualization by blending machine computation with human cognition. Computing with data visualizations directly, instead of just making visualizations. While integrating visual approaches with conventional machine learning methods.

# Alice Williams

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Alice, a double major B.Sc. student and former system administrator and full-stack software developer now studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics where I am in my final year, but exploring additional courses, before diving into graduate studies in Computational Science with a focus on Visual Machine Learning. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Visualization by blending computation with human cognition.

## Research Interests
- Visual Knowledge Discovery
- Data Mining & Data Visualization
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computational Science

## Authorship

**"Visual Boosting in Machine Learning with Human-in-the-Loop"**
- Written by: Alice Williams & Boris Kovalerchuk.
- Proposed for AI Human Computer Interfaces 2025.
- Contributions: Visual solution to the 2003 Gödel Prize problem of AdaBoost classifier by visual observation of options for different classifiers before selecting them for boosting allowing alternative ways to build stronger classifiers, including directly building classifiers in a lossless visualization space.

**"Synthetic Data Generation and Automated Multidimensional Data Labeling for AI/ML in General and Circular Coordinates"**
- Written by: Alice Williams & Boris Kovalerchuk.
- [ArXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02079)
- Presented at IV2024 (AI & VKD track) — Best Paper Award.
- Contributions: Proposed a novel algorithm for labeled synthetic data generation, improving data balancing and classifier performance.
